# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

X Education, an online course provider, attracts professionals to their website for course exploration. Lead generation occurs through form submissions and referrals. Despite numerous leads, the current conversion rate of 30% is unsatisfactory. To enhance efficiency, a logistic model is needed to assign lead scores (0 to 100) to every lead. Higher scores indicate 'Hot Leads' with better conversion potential. The objective is to achieve an 80% conversion rate by focusing on leads with higher scores. This model aims to optimize lead conversion and boost overall effectiveness.

Roadmap:
1.	Reading and Inspecting Data - Read, load, understand and analyse the data.
2.	Data Cleaning (Dropping Insignificant Columns) - Handling missing values and dropping insignificant variables.
3.	Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis - To gather insights from the data.
4.	Data Pre-processing for Model Building - Creating dummy variables,fFeature scaling and standardization, splitting into train and test sets, model building and selection.
5.	Making Predictions and Model Evaluation â€“ Evaluating model metrics, calculating lead score.
6.	Recommendations
